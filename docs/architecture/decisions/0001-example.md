## Status

Give it a status and ownership (for example, if accepted, by whom)

## Ticket

Link relevant ticket here 

## Context

Create context for the problem and decision scope as well as any related and supported documentation.

A complete ADR should demonstrate alternative approaches and research related to them.

## Decision

What was the decision made by the team

## Consequences

What were initial consequences in terms of architectural or infrasturcture decisions? 

If things were uncovered after the fact, add those here with dates

**Note: an ADR should be an immutable document, meaning don't alter existing info within it. Alternatively, you can amend it with new information and date the updates, or create a follow up ADR after the fact.

## After Actions

Best practice would be to come back to the ADR a month or so after the fact to compare the information vs what happened in actuality in an effort to learn and grow
